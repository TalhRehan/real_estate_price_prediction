The "Real Estate Price Prediction" project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the prices of real estate properties based on various features. The project utilizes Python programming language along with popular libraries such as NumPy, scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

Three different regression algorithms are employed for the prediction task:

1. DecisionTreeRegressor: This algorithm creates a decision tree model to predict prices based on the features of real estate properties. Decision trees split the data into subsets based on the values of input features, making it a powerful tool for regression tasks.

2. RandomForestRegressor: This ensemble learning technique builds multiple decision trees and merges their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Random forests are widely used for regression tasks due to their robustness and ability to handle large datasets.

3. Linear Regression: This classical regression method establishes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. While it may not capture complex patterns as effectively as decision trees or random forests, linear regression offers simplicity and interpretability.

By comparing the performance of these three models, the project aims to determine the most suitable algorithm for predicting real estate prices. The dataset likely includes various features such as property size, location, number of bedrooms, amenities, and more.

Throughout the project, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization will be performed using the mentioned Python libraries. The results will be analyzed to provide insights into the factors influencing real estate prices and to facilitate better decision-making for buyers, sellers, and investors in the real estate market..
